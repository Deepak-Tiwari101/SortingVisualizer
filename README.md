# SortingVisualizer

This project is not a very complex yet pretty helpful project for me as a Developer.
The website displays a number of bars that can be sorted using popular Sorting techniques and are animated to give a feel of the respective algorithms.
User can control the number of bars, speed of operation, which sorting algorithm to choose, start/stop the sorting.
Website is designed using Plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
